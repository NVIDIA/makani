    Round-trip tests for the state of the DALI training data pipeline under data
    parallelism, in isolation from the rest of the training state.

    The data pipeline is sharded over the ``batch`` comm, so every data-parallel
    rank walks a different subset of the samples and therefore holds a different
    state, while the checkpoint file is written by rank 0 of the ``data`` comm
    only. That asymmetry is what these tests cover: the state is gathered over
    the ``data`` comm on save and indexed back per rank on restore, so a rank
    must resume its OWN sample sequence and not some other rank's.

    Run with e.g.::

        # pure data parallel (B = 4)
        mpirun -n 4 pytest tests/distributed/tests_distributed_dataloader_checkpoint.py

        # ensemble x batch data parallelism on top of a 2x2 spatial grid
        GRID_H=2 GRID_W=2 GRID_E=2 mpirun -n 16 pytest tests/distributed/tests_distributed_dataloader_checkpoint.py

    With world_size=1 the tests still exercise the gather/scatter path, but the
    per-rank distinctness they are really after only shows up with B > 1.

        Sharding happens over the ``batch`` comm only, so ranks that differ solely in

        each reading its own spatial piece of it. If a restore put them at different
