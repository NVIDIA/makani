Distributed-test pytest config.

Suppresses pytest's console output on every rank except rank 0, so the combined
mpirun/srun stdout shows a single coherent test summary instead of N interleaved
copies. The silencing unregisters the terminal reporter in ``pytest_configure``
with ``@pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True)`` -- see that hook for why ``trylast`` is
required and why it must happen at configure time.

It also surfaces the full H x W x M x E x B decomposition (spatial h/w, matmul m,
ensemble e and the auto-filled batch remainder b): ``pytest_report_header`` prints
it once at the top of the session and ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` appends
``[h=H,w=W,...]`` to each distributed test's node id (m/e/b shown only when > 1).

Escape hatch: setting ``MAKANI_TEST_NO_SILENCE=1`` in the environment disables the
silencing on every rank -- useful when debugging a per-rank failure (e.g. a
distributed-bootstrap error in ``setUpClass``) that rank 0 doesn't reproduce.

    every rank look like rank 0 and nothing would get silenced. ``WORLD_RANK`` is
