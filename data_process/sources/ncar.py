    """Reader for NCAR ERA5 netCDF4 objects on S3, with optional local caching.

    The objects are chunked such that a single chunk holds one timestep of all
    pressure levels, so h5py byte range reads over S3 subset in time for free
    while subsetting in level is not possible. Open file handles are kept in a
    small LRU cache because a rank walks days in order and therefore revisits
    the same monthly surface file many times.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bucket : str
        Name of the S3 bucket to read from.
    cache_dir : str, optional
        If given, objects are downloaded here on first use and reopened from
        local disk afterwards. Downloads are staged through a temporary file and
        renamed into place, so concurrent ranks cannot observe a partial file.
    max_open : int, optional
        Number of file handles to keep open. Wants to comfortably exceed the
        number of monthly surface and accumulation files a day touches, since
        those are revisited on every day of the month; pressure level files are
        released explicitly and do not compete for slots.
    prefetch_workers : int, optional
        Number of background threads fetching upcoming objects. Zero disables
        prefetching and every object is read lazily on demand.

        Concurrency has to happen at this level rather than around the h5py
        reads: h5py serializes every HDF5 call behind a global lock, and because
        the file object is a Python fsspec stream the network waits happen
        inside that lock too, so threading the reads themselves buys nothing.
        Fetching whole objects in the background instead gives genuinely
        concurrent S3 streams and overlaps transfer with decompression.

        Each in flight object is held whole, in memory when streaming, so peak
        memory grows by roughly ``prefetch_workers`` times the object size, and
        pressure level files are on the order of a gigabyte. Size this against
        the ranks you place per node. With ``cache_dir`` set the prefetch lands
        on disk instead and costs no memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metadata : Dict
        Dataset metadata, see :class:`data_process.sources.Source`.
    comm_rank : int
        MPI rank, used to restrict informational output to rank 0.
    bucket : str
        Name of the S3 bucket holding the NCAR ERA5 data.
    cache_dir : str, optional
        Directory used to cache the raw NCAR files. Without it nothing is written
        to local disk, but an interrupted run has to refetch everything. Note that
        the raw files are considerably larger than the converted output.
    accumulation_hours : int, optional
        Length in hours of the window used for accumulated channels such as tp.
        Defaults to dhours. Windows longer than a forecast run are stitched
        together from consecutive runs.
    prefetch_workers : int, optional
        Background threads per rank fetching upcoming objects, overlapping
        transfer with decompression and giving each rank several concurrent S3
        streams. Zero, the default, reads lazily on demand. This only helps if
        the reads are latency bound rather than capped by aggregate bandwidth;
        when the link is already saturated it adds memory pressure for nothing.
        While streaming, peak memory grows by roughly this many object sizes,
        and pressure level objects are on the order of a gigabyte, so weigh it
        against the ranks placed per node.
    skip_missing_channels : bool
        Setting this flag to True will skip channels without an NCAR counterpart instead of failing.
    impute_missing_timestamps : bool
        Setting this flag to True will write NaN and mark ``valid_data`` for
        data that is not on the bucket, instead of failing. This works per
        channel group and day: if any object or timestep a group needs for a
        day is missing, all of that group's channels are imputed for the whole
        day. Typical case is converting the current year, where the forecast
        streams behind ``tp`` lag the analysis streams by about a month.
