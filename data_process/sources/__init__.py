"""ERA5 sources for ``data_process/convert_era5_to_makani_input.py``.

The converter owns everything the sources have in common: the metadata, the
date range, the yearly output files and their layout, the split of work over
MPI ranks and the progress bar. A source only knows how to read its archive
and is expected to subclass :class:`Source`.

Sources are kept free of MPI, so each backend module can be imported, and its
pieces tested, without an MPI installation; the backend modules are imported
lazily by the converter, so a source's own dependencies are only needed when it
is actually used.

    up to :attr:`units_per_fill` of those units. :meth:`close` is called once at
