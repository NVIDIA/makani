class BaseNoiseS2(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Abstract base class for random fields on the sphere :math:`S^2`.

    Noise for an ensemble weather model has to be spatially correlated: white
    noise on a lat-lon grid is neither isotropic (grid cells shrink toward the
    poles) nor physically plausible as a perturbation. All subclasses therefore
    generate noise in *spectral* space and transform it to the grid with an
    inverse SHT, which makes the correlation structure an explicit choice of
    angular power spectrum and keeps the field isotropic by construction.

    This base class owns the machinery every variant needs: the inverse SHT
    (distributed when spatial model parallelism is active), private RNGs, and a
    ``state`` buffer holding the current spectral coefficients. Subclasses
    define the spectrum and decide whether they are stateful (the field evolves
    from step to step, as in :class:`DiffusionNoiseS2`) or stateless (each draw
    is independent, as in :class:`IsotropicGaussianRandomFieldS2`).

    The state buffer is non-persistent: it is a per-run scratch tensor and is
    deliberately kept out of checkpoints, so restoring one does not resurrect a
    stale noise realization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_shape : (int, int)
        Output grid as ``(nlat, nlon)``.
    batch_size : int
        Initial batch size of the state buffer. Automatically resized when a
        different batch size is passed to ``update`` or ``reset``.
    num_channels : int
        Number of noise channels.
    num_time_steps : int
        Number of time steps held in the state.
    grid_type : str, optional
        Grid the noise is generated on, by default ``"equiangular"``.
    lmax : int, optional
        Spectral truncation. Defaults to the maximum supported by the grid;
        lowering it produces a smoother field.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for the private CPU and CUDA generators, by default ``333``.
    reflect : bool, optional
        If ``True``, negate every draw. Used for antithetic ensemble pairing:
        two members sharing a seed but differing in this flag produce exactly
        opposite perturbations, which cancels first-order sampling error in the
        ensemble mean. By default ``False``.
    **kwargs
        Ignored; present so noise configs can pass extra keys.

class IsotropicGaussianRandomFieldS2(BaseNoiseS2):
    r"""
    Isotropic Gaussian random field on the unit sphere. Stateless.

    Draws standard normal spherical harmonic coefficients, scales them by a
    per-degree standard deviation, and transforms to the grid. Because the
    scaling depends only on the degree :math:`l` and not the order :math:`m`,
    the resulting field is statistically isotropic -- no direction or location
    on the sphere is special, which a field generated directly on a lat-lon
    grid would not satisfy.

    The angular power spectrum follows a power law,

    .. math::

        \sigma_l = \sigma \sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)^{-\alpha}}{Z}},
        \qquad
        Z = \sum_l \frac{(2l+1)\,(2l+1)^{-\alpha}}{4\pi}

    where the normalization :math:`Z` fixes the pointwise variance of the field
    at :math:`\sigma^2` regardless of :math:`\alpha` or the truncation, so
    changing the correlation length does not silently change the amplitude.
    :math:`\alpha = 0` gives white noise; larger :math:`\alpha` damps high
    degrees and yields a smoother, longer-correlated field.

    Each call to ``update`` draws an independent realization, so the noise is
    stateless and :meth:`is_stateful` returns ``False``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_shape : (int, int)
        Output grid as ``(nlat, nlon)``.
    batch_size : int
        Initial batch size of the state buffer.
    num_channels : int
        Number of noise channels.
    num_time_steps : int, optional
        Number of time steps held in the state, by default ``1``.
    sigma : float, default is 1.0
        Scale parameter corresponding to the diagonal entry of the covariance
        kernel, i.e. the pointwise standard deviation of the field.
    alpha : float, default is 0.0
        Decay factor in the angular power spectrum. White noise corresponds to
        ``alpha = 0.0``.
    grid_type : string, default is "equiangular"
        Grid type. Currently supports ``"equiangular"`` and ``"legendre-gauss"``.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for the private generators, by default ``333``.
    reflect : bool, optional
        Negate every draw, for antithetic ensemble pairing. By default ``False``.
    learnable : bool, default is False
        Parameter which enables learnable Gaussian noise: the per-degree
        standard deviations become trainable instead of fixed, letting the
        model adapt the correlation structure during training.
    **kwargs
        Ignored; present so noise configs can pass extra keys.

def toep(c, r=None):

    Construct a Toeplitz matrix from its first column and row.

    Every diagonal of the result is constant: ``T[i, j]`` depends only on
    ``i - j``. Used here to build the discount matrix of powers of :math:`\phi`
    that correlates a freshly drawn noise history, so that resampling the whole
    history reproduces the temporal correlation of the process instead of
    giving independent steps.

    Vendored from SciPy to avoid a runtime dependency on it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        First column of the matrix. Flattened if not already 1D.
    r : array_like, optional
        First row of the matrix. ``r[0]`` is ignored -- ``c[0]`` sets the
        diagonal. Defaults to ``conj(c)``, which gives a Hermitian matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Array of shape ``(len(c), len(r))``.

class DiffusionNoiseS2(BaseNoiseS2):
    r"""
    Temporally correlated random field from a diffusion process on the sphere. Stateful.

    Perturbations in an ensemble forecast should not be redrawn independently at
    every step -- that produces noise the model damps out immediately rather
    than a coherent perturbation that grows. This module instead evolves the
    spectral coefficients as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, so each step is
    correlated with the last:

    .. math::

        \eta_{t+1} = \phi\, \eta_t + \sqrt{1 - \phi^2}\; \sigma_l\, \xi_t,
        \qquad \phi = e^{-\lambda}

    with :math:`\xi_t` standard normal. The prefactor
    :math:`\sqrt{1-\phi^2}` keeps the process stationary: the marginal variance
    stays at :math:`\sigma^2` for every :math:`t` instead of drifting as the
    correlation length changes. :math:`\lambda = \Delta t / \tau` sets how fast
    the field decorrelates in time, while ``kT`` sets the spatial correlation
    length through the angular power spectrum.

    Both ``kT`` and ``lambd`` may be given per channel, so different variables
    can carry perturbations at different scales.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_shape : (int, int)
        Output grid as ``(nlat, nlon)``.
    batch_size : int
        Initial batch size of the state buffer.
    num_channels : int
        Number of noise channels.
    num_time_steps : int, optional
        Number of time steps held in the state, by default ``1``.
    sigma : float, default is 1
        Stationary standard deviation.
    kT : float or List, default is 0.5 * (500 km / 6370 km)^2 = 0.00308057
        Spatial correlation length. If this is a list it has to match
        ``num_channels``.
    lambd : float or List, default is 1.0
        Temporal correlation length, should be set to ``(t / tau)``. If this is
        a list it has to match ``num_channels``.
    grid_type : string, default is "equiangular"
        Grid type. Currently supports ``"equiangular"`` and ``"legendre-gauss"``.
    seed : int, optional
        Seed for the private generators, by default ``333``.
    reflect : bool, optional
        Negate every draw, for antithetic ensemble pairing. By default ``False``.
    learnable : bool, default is False
        Parameter which enables learnable Diffusion noise: the per-degree
        standard deviations become trainable.
    **kwargs
        Ignored; present so noise configs can pass extra keys.

        Parameters

        replace_state : bool, optional
            If ``False`` (the default), take one autoregressive step: the

            *stationary* distribution. The first time step is scaled by
            :math:`1/\sqrt{1-\phi^2}` and, for ``num_time_steps > 1``, the

class DummyNoiseS2(BaseNoiseS2):
    r"""
    Dummy noise module for testing and debugging. This noise is stateless.

    The module always emits a tensor with the correct output shape
    ``(B, T, C, H, W)`` but carries no stochastic signal beyond what the chosen
    mode specifies. Unlike the real noise classes it stores its state in
    *spatial* rather than spectral layout and never runs an SHT, so it is cheap
    enough to use in tests that only care about shapes and control flow.

    Supported modes:

    ``constant_zero`` (default)
        Always emits an all-zero tensor. Useful for verifying shape consistency
        of the noise pipeline without introducing any stochastic signal. In
        particular, when the preprocessor is configured in ``"perturb"`` mode
        the noise is *added* to the model input channels. Returning zeros
        guarantees that the input is not modified, so integration tests can
        check shapes and control-flow correctness without having to account for
        random perturbations.

    ``constant_random``
        Draws a Gaussian tensor once per :meth:`update` call and holds it fixed
        until the next one. Useful for verifying that the model handles a
        non-zero, reproducible noise pattern correctly without the overhead of
        the spherical harmonic transform used by the real noise classes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_shape : (int, int)
        Number of latitudinal and longitudinal modes.
