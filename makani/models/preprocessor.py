class Preprocessor2D(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Input/output plumbing that surrounds the model in a rollout.

    Sits between the dataloader and the network and owns everything that is not
    the model itself: history handling, static and unpredicted features, noise
    injection, bias correction, and the normalization of the history window.
    Keeping this in one module is what lets the network see a single flat
    channel stack while the training loop still reasons in terms of time steps
    and variable groups.

    The main responsibilities are:

    * **History.** Inputs may carry ``n_history + 1`` time steps. These are
      flattened into the channel dimension for the model
      (:meth:`flatten_history`) and expanded back when needed
      (:meth:`expand_history`); :meth:`append_history` slides the window forward
      by one step during autoregressive rollout.
    * **Unpredicted features.** Quantities the model consumes but does not
      predict, such as the solar zenith angle, are cached per step and appended
      to the input. They must be carried over from the target to the input at
      each rollout step, since the model cannot generate them itself.
    * **Static features.** Time-invariant fields such as orography and the
      land-sea mask, appended to every input.
    * **Noise.** Optional stochastic perturbation of the input, either
      concatenated as extra channels or added to selected channels, for
      ensemble forecasting.
    * **Bias correction.** An optional additive correction applied to the
      model input.

        Slide the history window forward by one autoregressive step.

        Drops the oldest time step from ``x1`` and appends the new prediction
        ``x2``, producing the input for the next step of the rollout.

        This also advances the cached unpredicted features: quantities such as
        the solar zenith angle are known in advance but not predicted by the
        model, so the target's copy for this step has to be moved into the input
        buffer or the next step would be conditioned on stale values. Whether
        the train or eval buffers are updated follows the module's training
        mode.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x1 : torch.Tensor
            Current input history, shape ``(B, (n_history + 1) * C, H, W)``.
        x2 : torch.Tensor
            Newly predicted step, shape ``(B, C, H, W)``.
        step : int
            Index of the current rollout step, used to select the corresponding
            unpredicted features. Steps beyond the cached range leave the

        Compute and cache the normalization statistics for a history window.

        Must be called before :meth:`history_normalize` or
        :meth:`history_denormalize`, and re-called whenever the batch size
        changes. Statistics are area-weighted using the grid quadrature, so
        they are true spherical means rather than uniform grid averages, and
        are broadcast across the spatial model-parallel group so every rank
        normalizes identically.

        The behavior depends on ``history_normalization_mode``:

        * ``"none"`` -- statistics are set to zero mean and unit standard
          deviation, making normalization a no-op.
        * ``"timediff"`` -- statistics of the *differences* between consecutive
          time steps are cached instead, characterizing the tendency rather than
          the state.
        * anything else (e.g. ``"exponential"``) -- a weighted mean and standard
          deviation over the history window, using
          ``history_normalization_weights``.

        Notes
        -----
        ``batch_size`` resizes the state to the given batch; None leaves it at its
        current size. Resizing is guarded: the state carries an ``n_history + 1``
        time axis holding the autoregressive noise history, and reallocating it
        zeroes that history. Doing so while continuing an AR sequence
        (``replace_state`` falsy) would silently restart the noise from zero and
        yield a spin-up transient instead of the intended stationary distribution,
        so it is rejected.

        Only stateful noise (``DiffusionNoiseS2``) is guarded: white and dummy
        noise redraw from scratch every step, so for them a resize destroys
        nothing.

        This matches what every caller already does: the ensemble trainer and the
        inferencer resize only when priming an episode, always with
        ``replace_state=True``, and then roll forward at a fixed batch.
