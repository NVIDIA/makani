r"""
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator, version 3.

A cleaned-up, purely spectral SFNO. Compared to :mod:`makani.models.networks.sfnonet`:

* The input is band-limited *before* anything nonlinear happens. The encoder
  projects every input channel onto spherical harmonics up to one explicit
  cutoff ``lmax`` and evaluates the result on the internal grid; the pointwise
  encoder MLP, all processor blocks and the decoder MLP run at that resolution.
  The decoder maps back through the same cutoff. No block changes resolution.
* Wind components are treated as what they are: a tangent vector field. Every
  ``(u, v)`` pair in ``channel_names`` goes through the vector spherical
  harmonic transform, whose two components (divergent and rotational) are
  carried as latent scalar fields and recombined by the inverse vector
  transform in the decoder. This is the only encoding of ``(u, v)`` that is
  exactly equivariant under rotations about the polar axis.
* The spectral cutoff is one number, ``lmax = mmax``, computed from the
  band limit of the internal grid (never larger than that of the input and
  output grids) and passed explicitly to every transform. Nothing relies on a
  torch-harmonics default.
* The only position-dependent parameter is an optional per-latitude embedding,
  which keeps the network exactly equivariant under rotations about the axis.
* Global context enters through :class:`FilmS2`: a feature-wise affine
  modulation whose coefficients are an MLP of the spherical mean of the block
  input. Spherical means are invariant under every isometry, so the layer does
  not break any symmetry the rest of the network has.
* The spectral filter is the linear :class:`~makani.models.common.SpectralConv`
  with one complex weight per degree :math:`\ell` (``"dhconv"``). There is no
  DISCO convolution and no spectral attention.
* Z-scoring subtracts a constant from ``u`` and ``v``, i.e. the vector field
  :math:`\bar u\,\hat e_\lambda + \bar v\,\hat e_\phi`, which is singular at the
  poles and not band-limited. The model adds that bias back (in normalized
  units) before every vector transform and removes it after every inverse, so
  the transforms always see the physical wind up to a common scale. This
  needs the ``normalization_means``/``normalization_stds`` that
  :func:`~makani.models.model_registry.get_model` passes; without them the
  offsets are zero.
* Initialization keeps the variance of the residual stream: blocks are
  pre-norm with a :class:`~makani.models.common.LayerScale` on the branch,
  every linear map is drawn with ``gain / fan_in`` for a unit-variance output,
  and the FiLM layer and the latitude embedding start as exact identities.

What is *not* done here, deliberately: the rotational wind component is a
pseudo-scalar under reflection at the equator, and the processor treats it like
any other channel, so the network is equivariant under axial rotations but not
yet under that reflection. The latitude embedding is not symmetrized either.

    Construct a (vector) spherical harmonic transform with an explicit triangular cutoff.

    The single place in this file that calls into torch-harmonics constructors.
    Handles the serial/distributed choice and both constructor conventions:
    the ``(nlat, nlon, grid=...)`` signature of torch-harmonics 0.9.x, which
    the rest of makani uses, and the grid-descriptor signature of 1.0, which
    is selected whenever :func:`torch_harmonics.as_grid` exists. Migrating the
    model to grid descriptors therefore touches only this function.

    Pre-norm residual block in the style of the FCN3.1 block, with the linear
    spectral convolution as its only spatial operator. Input and output live
    on the same grid.

    Initialization keeps the variance of the residual stream: the spectral

    unit variance for unit-variance input, and the branch enters the stream
    through a :class:`~makani.models.common.LayerScale` of ``layer_scale_init``.
    With ``skip="identity"`` the stream is therefore preserved exactly at
    initialization; with ``skip="linear"`` the skip is drawn with unit gain
    and preserves it in expectation.

        Number of input and output channels. Must agree with the channel names.
    channel_names : list of str
        Names of the predicted channels. Wind pairs are recognized as
        ``u<suffix>``/``v<suffix>``.

        ``hard_thresholding_fraction``. Always used as ``mmax`` too.
    hard_thresholding_fraction : float, optional
        Fraction of the band limit to keep when ``lmax`` is not given, by default ``1.0``.

        Hidden width of the FiLM MLP as a multiple of ``embed_dim``, by default ``1.0``.
    wind_spectral_scaling : str, optional
        Which quantity the latent wind fields represent; see :func:`_wind_spectral_scale`.
        By default ``"energy"``.

    normalization_means, normalization_stds : array-like, optional
        Per-channel bias and scale of the z-scoring, in the order of
        ``channel_names``. Used only to undo the bias on wind components
        around the vector transforms; see the module docstring.
    **kwargs
        Ignored; present so model configs can pass extra keys.
