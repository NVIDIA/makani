"""Helpers for reading NSF NCAR ERA5 (RDA dataset d633000) from S3.

The bucket ``s3://nsf-ncar-era5`` hosts ERA5 on its native 0.25 degree
lat/lon grid, which is already identical to the grid makani expects
(latitude 90 -> -90, longitude 0 -> 359.75), stored as netCDF4/HDF5.

Object keys follow::

    <stream>/<YYYYMM>/<stream>.<param>_<short_name>.ll025<grid>.<start>_<end>.nc

with one file per variable per *day* for pressure levels, per *month* for
surface analysis, and per *half month* for the accumulated forecast fields.

Two things make this source awkward, and they are what most of this module is:

* **Object keys have to be constructed, not discovered.** Listing a bucket this
  large per read is not viable, so the key of every file is derived from the
  variable descriptor and the date. The three stream layouts each need their own
  rule, see :func:`analysis_pl_key`, :func:`analysis_sfc_key` and
  :func:`accumulation_key`.
* **Precipitation has to be reassembled.** d633000 ships no total precipitation
  and no ready-made accumulation window: ``tp`` is ``lsp + cp``, summed over an
  hour range that may straddle two forecast runs, since a run reaches forecast
  hour 12 while runs start 12 hours apart. :func:`resolve_accumulation_segments`
  does that arithmetic.

Channel grouping itself is shared with the other readers and lives in
:mod:`makani.utils.dataloaders.channel_helpers`.

    Unlike the ECMWF forecast archive, where accumulated fields are running
    totals from the start of a run, d633000 stores them already de-accumulated:
    forecast hour ``h`` holds the accumulation over the single hour ending at
    ``init_time + h``. The value over a window is therefore a plain sum of the
    hours it spans, ``run[forecast_hour_start:forecast_hour_end]`` in zero based
    indexing.

    A run only reaches forecast hour 12 while runs start 12 hours apart, so a
    window is not always contained in a single run: a 12 hour window ending at
    00Z, for instance, starts at 12Z, which is between the 06Z and 18Z runs. The
    window is therefore walked forward and cut at run boundaries, and the
    resulting pieces sum to the total.

    Parameters
    ----------
    valid_time : datetime.datetime
        Timezone aware UTC time at which the accumulation window ends.
    window_hours : int
        Length of the accumulation window in hours. Must be positive.
