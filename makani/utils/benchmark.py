"""Measurement and bookkeeping helpers for the benchmark driver (``makani/benchmark.py``).

Three separate concerns live here:

1. :class:`StepTimer` -- per-step wall time, recorded with CUDA events so the
   measurement is not distorted by the asynchronous launch queue. It is
   constructed (disabled) by every :class:`~makani.utils.driver.Driver`, so the
   trainers can call ``begin_step``/``end_step`` unconditionally and pay nothing
   outside a benchmark run.

2. Provenance -- what was actually run: the decomposition ``comm`` built, the
   config file and config line, the software/hardware environment.

3. Comparability -- a hash over the parts of the resolved configuration that
   have to match before two step times mean the same thing. Deliberately
   *excludes* the decomposition and the world size, since those are the axes a
   benchmark suite varies.

    instead means any config benchmarks out of the box.
